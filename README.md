# Online-Retail-Order-Value
This project asks a key question: Can we predict an order’s value using only the details from a single transaction? Using the UCI Online Retail dataset (2010–2011), I explore patterns in product mix, quantity, pricing, and timing, then train a linear regression model to see how well these features can explain and predict total order value.
